# Sentiment Analysis App

This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis App that allows users to input text and analyze the sentiment expressed in the text.

## Features

- Analyze sentiment of text input using a machine learning model
- Preprocess text data by removing stopwords, tokenizing, and lemmatizing
- Utilize a TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction
- Train a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification
- Web-based interface for user interaction
- Simple and intuitive user experience

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Getting Started
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd sentiment-analysis-app
Run the application:


python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the Sentiment Analysis App.

Usage
Enter the text you want to analyze in the input field.
Click the "Analyze" button.
The app will process the text and display the sentiment analysis result.
Data
The sentiment analysis model in this app was trained on a publicly available sentiment analysis dataset. The dataset used for training can be found in the data-set directory.

Customization
You can customize and improve the sentiment analysis model by:

Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)
Trying out different feature extraction techniques (e.g., word embeddings)
Collecting more training data to improve the model's performance

Acknowledgments
The sentiment analysis model in this app is based on the work of Jason Brownlee and Susan Li.
The dataset used for training the sentiment analysis model is from the Sentiment140 dataset on Kaggle.
The Flask framework was used for building the web application.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) was used for text preprocessing and the WordNet lemmatizer.
Scikit-learn was used for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
